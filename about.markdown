Welcome, and thanks for your interest.

This Jekyll-based blog supports my open source projects listed on [Github](https://github.com/theonaunheim).

If you have general questions the best way to get a hold of me is via messages on LinkedIn. If you have problems with specific problems that you think qualifies for a bug report, you're probably best-served by filing an issue on the project on Github.
